# Lasswell | The Lasswell Value Dictionary categories. This dictionary divides language into four deference domains: power, rectitude, respect, affiliation, and four welfare domains: wealth, well-being, enlightenment and skill. Within each domain, there may be such subcategories as gains, losses, participants, ends, and arenas. In addition to subcategory counts, there is a total count for each domain. The dictionary authors avoided categorizing a word or word sense in more than one domain and one subcategory in that domain, even though more than one domain or more than one subcategory may be relevant. However, a few consistency errors have been uncovered by the spreadsheet conversion.
